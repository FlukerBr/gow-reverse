*3026*
[*1] CENTAUR ORIGINAL DESIGN
I originally wanted the centaur to be a
hellish, nightmarish style creature.
----
In this first design, you can see he's
wearing a tribal war mask.
----
He also has all of his skin stripped off
so you can just see tendons, meat, and veins.
----
But - as you can see - we just didn't have
the texture resolution to pull this idea
off.
----
Instead of being creepy and nasty,
it looks muddy and unfinished. So we ended
up scrapping this idea.

*3027*
[*1] CYCLOPS VERSION 1 - FROG MAN
This was our first pass at the Cyclops.
---- 
We scrapped it because - as you can see -
it sort of looked like a frog.
----
It was a totally non-threatening design
and I'm glad we killed it.

*3028*
[*1] CYCLOPS VERSION 2 - RED EYE
We were having a hard time getting the
single eye of the Cyclops models to read.
----
It was really hard for players to see
that the model only had one eye. So this
model was an attempt to bring
----
the single eye concept to the attention of
players. However, this attempt fell short.
It just looked goofy.
----
It kind of sucks that even our FINAL Cyclops
- the one in the game now - still doesn't
really look like it has just one eye.
----
Ah well, maybe next time.

*3029*
[*1] CYCLOPS VERSION 3 - HUMAN FACE
I really like this guy. It creeps me out
because it looks like a human face stuck
----
onto this beastly body.
The thing is, it didn't really fit the vibe
of the game.
----
Instead, this Cyclops came across as sad
and human. I actually felt sorry for it.

*3030*
[*1] CYCLOPS VERSION 4 - CARTOON CYCLOPS
This guy felt too cartoony for the game.
----
This version is more like a character you'd see
in a T-rated platformer.

*3031*
[*1] CYCLOPS VERSION 5 - ACTION FIGURE
This version was pretty neat, but it was just
too cartoony. It felt like a toy.
----
The skulls on the chest made it feel like one
of the accessories you get when you buy
an action figure.

*3032*
[*1] CYCLOPS VERSION 6 - PATCHWORK CYCLOPS
Now this guy was nasty.
I still think he was pretty cool.
----
Looking at him now, I'm wondering WHY
we didn't use him. I am sure there was
a good reason but I just can't recall.
----
Sure, the eye looks bad, but that could
have been fixed. But the body texture
is really cool.
----
Better keep this guy in mind for
future projects. He's great.

*3033*
[*1] KRATOS VERSION 1 - GIANT IN A DIAPER
This was a placeholder of the hero.
----
We needed something to put in the game
while we were still locking the design
of Kratos.
----
The model was always meant to be a throwaway
model, but even so, I have no clue why the
artists chose to model a fat guy wearing a diaper.
----
Boy, if Kratos only knew what he looked
like way back when.

*3034*
[*1] KRATOS VERSION 2 - MEDIEVAL WARRIOR
This model looked too medieval for the Ancient
Greek setting. Still, I like this guy.
----
I think he's kind of cool. There is something very
heroic about him that works for me.

*3035*
[*1] KRATOS VERSION 3 - DREADLOCKS
Our first art director wanted this to be
the hero. I could tell he was really into
----
this design so I tried to support it.
But it just didn't sit well with me.
This model is not brutal enough,
----
not vicious enough, to be the star of
GOD OF WAR. I'm glad we changed it, even
though I think it pissed off the art director.

*3036*
[*1] KRATOS VERSION 4 - COOL ARMOR KRATOS
This is my favorite design for Kratos.
We could not use it however, because there was
----
too much detail in the armor.
When we put this in the game, amid the detailed
backgrounds, the hero did not look very good.
----
Maybe if we make another Kratos game - on more
powerful hardware - we can use this cool outfit
and it will look better on newer technology.

*3037*
[*1] KRATOS VERSION 5 - BLUE TATTOO
This was almost the final Kratos design.
----
I really wanted red tattoos with white
skin, but we felt that color scheme was
too cliche. So we decided on blue.
----
It was blue for a while, but I just
could not live with it. My gut
said red tattoos were the way to go.
----
Looking at it now, I am glad we changed 
it, as I like the red tattoos much
better.

*3038*
[*1] MEDUSA VERSION 1 - QUINTUPLE FEET
The main thing to notice is her feet.
----
In the final game she has no feet, just a tail.
Animating five feet slithering all around
just proved to be too much.
----
Also, note that this character has nipples.
She was created at the start of the game
and all the female monsters had nipples.
----
And the Cyclops even had a penis!
I really wanted the monsters to come off
like wild animals, like things you would see
----
at the zoo. So I thought those elements helped.
End of the day, we got to keep the nipples but
we lost the penis on the Cyclops.
----
Poor Cyclops.

*3039*
[*1] SKELETON VERSION 1 - OLD SCHOOL
Inspired by the action-adventure movies
many of us grew up with, this was
----
our first skeleton/zombie/undead soldier.
End of the day, we felt this was just too
plain of a design for today's audience.
----
It was a hard call as this simpler design
really resonated with those who had grown
up with the adventure flicks of the 1970's...
----
But we wanted GOD OF WAR's characters to
be more original. So we scrapped the idea.

*3040*
[*1] SKELETON VERSION 2 - HELMET HEAD
A really great design.
----
I love the skeleton head and how the bone
itself is shaped like a Roman/Greek helmet.
----
In the end, cool as the design was,
it did not look all that good when we got
5 - 8 of these guys on screen.
----
So we went with something simpler.

*3041*
