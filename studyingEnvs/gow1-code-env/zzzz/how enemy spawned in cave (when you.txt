how enemy spawned in cave (when you need push button with frozen enemy to open door) on level ATHN03A:

Object cavegatea1 has attached entities in ESC_CaveGateA1. One of such entity CaveGateA1-volumeGateClose-EntryGateClose has type 0. Entity type 0 - entry sensors (triggers when player enters hidden collision). This entity will trigger when player get close to gates. Each entity has different parameters, and this parameters not just values, but scripts. That's why they called "handlers".

For entity type 0 it's known that if handler #1 returns -1 it means that this trigger can be triggered only once. Handler #4 represents what should be done on trigger event, in case of this gate it locks player with Idle(TRUE) to play animation of locking gate.

Besides running handlers code entity can trigger other entities. This entities can be found in DependsEntitiesIds field. In gate sensor entity this field has a lot of entities ids [13,11,18,41,47,48,51,55,56,58,59,60,61], it's because lots of stuff have to be done: music change, checkpoint, play animations, lock/unlock player, update level variables and SPAWN MINOTAURS.

To spawn enemies game uses Entity type 10. In our case we have minotaurs spawn in object grpminolvl2room entities ESC_GRPMinoLVL2Room.
This object has 4 entity:
GRPMinoLVL2Room-MinotaurLevel2AI2 (entity id 47) (type 10) - first minotaur
GRPMinoLVL2Room-MinotaurLevel2AI4 (entity id 48) (type 10) - second minotaur
GRPMinoLVL2Room-MinotaurLevel2AI5 (entity id 49) (type 10) - spawner for next minotaurs (when one of first two killed)
GRPMinoLVL2Room-DestructionSensor1 (entity id 50) (type 3) - destruction sensor which triggers entity above (entity id 49) when minotaur killed (respawns minotaurs)

Let's look on one of spawner entitiy (entity id 47).
Kind of enemy which is spawned by this spawner entity located in handler #4. In our case handler #4 returns value 51 as enemy type. This value represents TWK AI index of enemy kind we want to spawn. In our case 51 means R_MI2.WAD => TWK_AI1_051.

Problem is if we want to change this AI id to any other enemy type we should make sure that this enemy wad loaded. This can be done by checking/editing ATHN03A.WAD => RSRCS (probably short for resources). In our case level ATHN03A also loads SKA and MI2 as resources. Since SKA already loaded by this level, let's change our minotaur to archer.

Open R_SKA.WAD, search for TWK_AI. In our case archer has AI ids 31 (archer Lvl 1), 32 (archer Lvl 1 -P) and 39 (dumbArcher). Let's replace one minotaur with archer 31. Idk how to explain properly, so check picture.
